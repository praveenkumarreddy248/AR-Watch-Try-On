# AR-Watch-Try-On
AR VR Project

Instructions:

Testing in Unity Editor:
Make sure your Unity Editor is set up and configured with the Vuforia license key and necessary settings.

Click the Play button in the Unity Editor to enter Play mode.

In Play mode, the Unity Editor simulates the AR experience. You can test the functionality and interactions within the editor.

Building and Running on a Device:
To deploy your AR watch try-on project to a physical device, follow these steps:

Connect your device to your computer.

In Unity, go to File > Build Settings.

Select the target platform (e.g., Android or iOS).

Click on Switch Platform if necessary.

Click on Add Open Scenes to add your current scene to the build.

Click Build and Run to compile the project and deploy it to your connected device.

Follow the on-screen instructions to install and launch the app on your device.

Test the AR experience on your device:

Point your device's camera at the image target (e.g., the predefined image marker for the watch).

The AR watch model should appear and track with the image target as you move your device.

Troubleshooting:
If the AR experience does not work as expected, check the Unity Console for error messages.

Ensure that the Vuforia license key is correctly entered in the Vuforia Configuration.

Verify that the image target and 3D model are properly configured and aligned.

Check the Vuforia and Unity documentation for troubleshooting tips and updates.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and test your AR watch try-on project both in the Unity Editor and on a physical device. Remember to refer to the Unity and Vuforia documentation for any platform-specific considerations or updates.
